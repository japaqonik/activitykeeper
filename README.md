Simple app that changes cursor position in configurable period of time in order to prevent screen lock in Windows OS. If "Shadow moves" option is disabled cursor is moved 1px diagonally, each time in opposite direction. When "Shadow moves" is enabled cursor is moved twice (1px diagonally and back) which makes such move imperceptible to the human eye.
